	According to AI-Infused Academic Planning for Student Excellence (2025). This work aims to revolutionize educational management by leveraging cutting-edge technologies to address the unique challenges faced by individuals in managing academic pursuits, while dealing with their diverse other commitments. This paper focuses on utilizing genetic learning algorithms to dynamically generate optimized study schedules based on individual profiles, promoting efficient time management and improving learning outcomes.
